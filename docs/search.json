    "text": "üë®‚Äçüè´: Stephen Holt, Ph.D.\nüìÖ: Wednesdays from 6:00 pm to 8:50 pm in Husted 204\nüìß: sbholt@albany.edu\nüè´: Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm or by appointment - book here; in-person in Milne 324 or online in GatherTown.1\n‚òéÔ∏è: 518-442-3309\n\n\n\nThis course introduces computer-based tools for planning, policy analysis, and decision making. Topics include evaluating the quality of data for decision making, database construction and information management, administrative and policy models in datasets, making decisions with multiple criteria, an introduction to probability, and the use of simulation models as testbeds for policy making. Emphasis is placed on summarizing information meaningfully for policy makers and different stakeholders and using replicatable workflows in common statistical software packages.\nBy the end of this course, students should be able to 1) critically analyze administrative problems and evaluate potential solutions; 2) consider questions of accountability and responsiveness in administrative action; and 3) analyze the potential challenges in implementing public programs through both public and private organizations. Students should leave class with a deep understanding of both the technical challenges and competing values present in implementing and managing public programs.2\n\n\n\nThere is no required text for the class.\nAdditional readings will be made available on Zotero in the class library.\n\n\n\nStata18/IC - The student version of Stata is sufficient for the course. The software costs $48 for a 6 month license (sufficient for this course) and purchase information can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen you order Stata, the company will send an email with a link to the download and a pdf with the license information you will need to enter after installing the software to activate it. Please do this before the second week of class. Typically, they provide this within a few hours of the order, but it‚Äôs worth accounting for the possibility of delays.\n\n\nStata is a statistical software that will provide an opportunity for you to learn the basic logic and intuition using code to conduct data analysis. The coding language for Stata is very simple, clear, and straight forward, so it serves as a good entry point to getting comfortable using programming languages for analyzing data and learning more about the world around us. Once you adjust to the basics of analysis with an easy and intuitive coding language like Stata, transitioning to other software languages (e.g., R, Python in industry; SAS, SQL in government) will be much less onerous.\nZotero - Zotero is a free platform for organizing and sharing academic work and it is how readings will be distributed to the class. You can download the app here. I suggest also downloading the browser connector for whatever browser you use - it helps save a dramatic amount of time when conducting a literature review. During the first week of classes you will receive an invitation to join the class Zotero library. If you do not receive one, please email the professor. I provide an introduction to Zotero and the features most applicable to this class in the embedded video below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are a variety of citation organizer software options out there for researchers to use and, having experimented with most of them, Zotero is by far the best. It is free; Open Source; designed and developed by researchers; and governed as a non-profit to protect the integrity and accessibility of the software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip on Zotero\n\n\n\nWhen you receive an announcement that the group invitations for the class library have been sent, go to the Zotero.org website, login to your account, and click the groups tab. You should see RPAD 504 with a red button that says join. Click join. In the Zotero app, click the green refresh circle in the top right and the class library should appear.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach week, our in-person meetings will involve a mix of lecture and application of class concepts in lab work. Often class time will be split between these two activities evenly, but some sessions will lean deeper into one or the other based on the material. As group work gears up, I will allocate some time in the back end of class time for working with groups on the final report assignment. At the end of class, attendance will be taken each week and that will factor directly into students‚Äô participation grade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Note on Groups\n\n\n\nIn this class you tackle one (1) broader research project on a team. This is by design because most professional work is conducted on teams, most decisions in public work are made by consensus, and opportunities to learn to adjust to different working styles while managing projects helps develop important and transferable skills. Once groups are assigned, I strongly encourage you to meet with your groups with an early video call and get to know each other, your schedules, and so on. Communication helps dramatically in successful groups. That said, some group dynamics can - in very rare circumstances - become bad for all involved. I provide two means for coping: first, students can use peer evaluations to ensure accountability in group work. And second, if that is insufficient, the group can vote to remove a member and inform me of the decision. No harm, no foul. This should be considered a measure of last resort and only pursued if a group member has made no contributions to the group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following assignments will form the basis of your grade in this course:\n\nFinal Report (35 points)\nWeekly Problem Sets (30 points)\nMid-term Exam (15 points)\nFinal Exam (15 points)\nParticipation (5 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll assignments will be turned in via Brightspace.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo assess your understanding of the course material and your ability to apply concepts to real policy issues, you will be working in groups to prepare a 20 page report that i) describes a social problem with policy implications or an emerging policy issue, ii) uses data to describe the problem statistically, and iii) makes an informed recommendation on a policy change to improve the conditions that define the problem. The primary datasets used in the examples and problem sets throughout the course will be the datasets you will draw upon to construct your report. We will go over an example the second week of class to introduce you to the mix of art and science that goes into crafting good policy reports using data. You will also prepare a presentation for these results to deliver at the end of the semester (see Section¬†1.7.1).\nAcceptable sources. Generally, your research should use primary sources more than secondary sources. Primary sources include, but are not limited to: government reports, legislative hearings and testimonies, court decisions, government auditor reports, and rigorous academic research. Secondary sources are summaries and interpretations of primary sources. Secondary sources include, but are not limited to, articles from major newspapers and news magazines and more conceptual or theoretical academic research. Blogs and Wikipedia are not acceptable sources (though both can be good ways to get a broad sense of a topic before digging deeper). Be an intelligent consumer of information by evaluating secondary sources for potential political bias. If it is well known that a particular source is liberal or conservative, you must compensate for this in the paper. Acknowledge its bias and balance the information with something from a source on the other side of the political spectrum. Here are some places to start with your research, but feel free to consult other sources:\n\nAcademic research published in public administration, political science, economics, or policy journals such as: Nature Human Behaviour, Public Administration Review, Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, Journal of Public Policy Analysis and Management, American Political Science Review, American Journal of Political Science, Journal of Politics, American Economic Review, Journal of Labor Economics, Journal of Human Resources, Quarterly Journal of Economics, Policy Studies Journal.\nCongressional testimony (available through Lexis/Nexis via the library) and reports completed by Congressional committee staff\nAgency Inspector General reports\nCongressional Research Service reports\nU.S. Government Accountability Office reports\nThe library also has research support services for this class, which can be found here\n\nSubmission of papers. The final report will be due by midnight on the designated due date (details to be distributed early in the semester). Electronic versions of the paper are to be submitted via the SafeAssign link in Brightspace. It is the student‚Äôs responsibility to ensure the electronic file is readable and not corrupted. Please note: once you hit the submit button in SafeAssign, you cannot go back and submit a different version.\nLate assignments. An assignment is considered late if the paper copy is not submitted at the beginning of class, if the electronic file is not submitted before class, and/or if the electronic file is not readable. Assignments (electronic or hard copy) submitted 10 minutes after the beginning of class or the launch of the following module will be considered late and will be automatically reduced by 10%. Papers submitted one day after the due date will be automatically reduced by 20%; essays submitted two days after the assigned date will be reduced by 30%, etc. Exceptions will be made for documented extreme health and family emergencies.\n\n\n\nFor 10 weeks throughout the semester (see Section¬†1.7.1 for the specific weeks), problem sets will be posted to Brightspace and the course site by the end of the day Thursday. They will be due before the start of class the following week, leaving both weekend and weekday stretches available for you to complete the problem sets. Problem sets will involve applying concepts and activities we complete in class together to new but similar datasets and problems on your own. You will be expected to turn in 1) a clean answer sheet that provides the final solution to any problem; and 2) a .log file that shows the code used to derive the solutions to the problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe problem set will be cumulative in the sense that each week will add new concepts and issues for you to tackle that will often build on skills used the previous week. This carries two important implications. First, you will want to be careful not to miss any problem sets, as they provide important opportunities to confirm your progress in the class and understanding of the skills we are learning and missing problem sets might compound any struggles you are having. Second, each week will likely have opportunities to practice skills learned in prior weeks en route to practicing new material.\n\n\nEach problem set is worth 3 points.\n\n\n\nThere will be two in-class exams over the course of the semester. The week before the exam, study aids will be distributed and the exams will be taken in-class. Details about the exams will be provided ahead of the scheduled exams.\n\n\n\nAttendance and participation in class discussion and activities will determine the participation points you earn at the end of the semester.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nüë®‚Äçüè´:\nLecture\n\n\n‚úÖ:\nProblem Set\n\n\nüë•:\nLab\n\n\nüìÖ:\nExam or Final Report Due\n\n\nüìÑ:\nReading is from an article/chapter on Zotero (by author last name)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nTopic\nAssignments\nReadings\n\n\n\n\n8/28\nIntro to course\n\n\n\n\n9/4\nData Origins\nüë®‚Äçüè´\nüìÑ Knox et al.¬† üìÑ Llolbrera & Hall  üìÑ Holt & Vinopal\n\n\n9/11\nAssessing Data Quality\nüë®‚Äçüè´\n\n\n\n9/18\nSummarizing Data I\nüë®‚Äçüè´  ‚úÖ  üë•\n\n\n\n9/25\nSummarizing Data II\nüë®‚Äçüè´  ‚úÖ  üë•\n\n\n\n10/2\nData Management I\nüë®‚Äçüè´  ‚úÖ  üë•\n\n\n\n10/9\nData Management II\nüë®‚Äçüè´  ‚úÖ  üë•\n\n\n\n10/16\nMidterm Exam\nüìÖ\n\n\n\n10/23\nGeographic Information and Mapping Data\nüë®‚Äçüè´  ‚úÖ  üë•\n\n\n\n10/30\nWriting About Data\nüë®‚Äçüè´  ‚úÖ  üë•\n\n\n\n10/30\nLight Statistics Introduction\nüë®‚Äçüè´  ‚úÖ  üë•\n\n\n\n11/6\nStatistical Models I\nüë®‚Äçüè´  ‚úÖ  üë•\n\n\n\n11/13\nStatistical Models II\nüë®‚Äçüè´  ‚úÖ  üë•\n\n\n\n11/20\nPresentations and Wrap\nüë®‚Äçüè´  ‚úÖ üìÖ\n\n\n\n11/27\nThanksgiving Break\n\n\n\n\n12/4\nFinal Exam\nüìÖ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic policy is a professional field; therefore, I emphasize professional skills in the classroom and assignments. Professional skills are punctuality, adhering to deadlines, and preparedness.\nAfter the first week, readings for each week should be completed by the Tuesday of that week (that is, BEFORE CLASS!). While much of the class reading comes from assigned readings, I will cover other material in my lectures. You will be responsible for knowing this material too!\nA large body of well-designed research has demonstrated the detrimental effects of laptops on learning in a lecture/discussion based environment. Please be courteous and do not use your computers for anything other than class related work (taking notes and so on). Cellular phones are not to be used during class time!\nLetters of recommendation. If you are a hard working student and serious about a career in public service, I will be a dedicated advocate for you on the job market and will happily write letters of recommendation on your behalf. There is, however, one condition and one recommendation. The condition: I will not write a letter of recommendation for your while you are in my class. This is because to write a good faith, sincere, and thoughtful recommendation, I will need to be able to consider your work as a whole, and while the class is on-going, my assessment of you will be incomplete. After the semester is over, I am happy to help in any way I can, including writing letters. The recommendation: Make an appointment to visit my office hours at least once over the course of the semester to talk informally about your goals, career interests, and other professional ambitions so I can get a better sense of who you are as individuals. The better I know you, the more effective I can be at writing letters on your behalf and thinking of you when opportunities arise.\nAttend/participate in class! Again, class participation is 5% of your grade, and you can‚Äôt participate if you‚Äôre not in class or watching the class videos. If you DO need to miss class (emergencies, sickness, etc.), please contact me as soon as possible and let me know. It will be your responsibility to notify me and to get any notes/materials from other students.\nCell phones: we all have them, and they can be quite distracting. I ask that you please be courteous and silence your cell phone and leave it out of sight (in a pocket/purse/bag) during class.\nFeel free to eat and drink in class. I only ask that you do so quietly and in a manner that does not disrupt class.\nAll assignments and non-textbook readings will be posted to the class Zotero Library. I will email any announcements or updates to the class and also post them in the Blackboard. Report any trouble accessing anything on the Blackboard as soon as you encounter the problem.\nI have a strict open door policy. If there is anything about the course, the assignments, the grading, the material, class, or anything related to public administration/policy or statistics broadly that you would like to discuss, do not hesitate to visit me during office hours or email me. I can respond via email, schedule a phone call, or schedule a separate meeting. I am here to help, so please do not hesitate to reach out to me. (But please be respectful of my time!)\nHAVE FUN! Public administration/policy is a broad topic that explores big, important questions that affect everyone. Discussing these topics should be as fun and interesting as it is challenging.\nThe table below lays out the grading scale that will be used in assigning final course grades.\nStudents with special physical and/or learning needs will be accommodated. Please notify the Disabilities Office and me as soon as possible so that reasonable accommodations can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThroughout the semester, I may add or subtract readings as needed to adjust the course according to your progress, engagement, and interests.\n\n\nTable.

Each assignment is weighted by the proportion of the final grade made up by the assignment itself, as described above.\n\n\n\n\nAcademic honesty is something your professor takes very seriously. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated. Students are required to be familiar with the university‚Äôs academic honesty policies; ignorance is not an excuse for dishonest behavior. In all cases of cheating, a Violation of Academic Integrity Report will be submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies to be placed in your university file, with copies provided to you, the department head, and the Dean of Rockefeller College. Additional penalties may include some combination of the following: revision and re-submission of the assignment, reduction of the grade or failure of the assignment, reduction of the course grade or failure of the course, filing of a case with the Office of Conflict Resolution and Civic Responsibility, suspension, or expulsion. For a more detailed description of the university‚Äôs academic honesty policies, visit the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT and Other LLMs\n\n\n\nBy now, we are all aware of the technological advances in generative large language models (LLMs) trained on large quantities of written language scraped from around the internet. The University policy considers the use of ChatGPT and other generative LLMs to produce classwork without explicit permission from the instructor an act of plagiarism. I do not permit the use of ChatGPT or other generative LLMs in this course. First, generative LLMs can at times invent fictional sources, recombine information that is confidently stated but ultimately incorrect, and can produce generally mediocre and formulaic writing. Such events make the output unreliable - particularly for people aiming to be professionals working in the institutions that govern our society. Second, and more importantly, grappling with complicated trade-offs, collecting and synthesizing complex information thoughtfully, and going through the process of articulating your decisions and the knowledge base that inform them is a large part of an effective professional career. Learning in general is an arduous process that involves practice, trial and error, and confronting your current limits before finding ways to overcome them. In short, learning is work and the process by which that work occurs is often reading and writing, poorly at first and much better over time. I do think that, properly understood, LLMs can be a useful tool in managing routine tasks in which you have mastered the background, can detect and correct errors, and can use such tools effectively. However, early in your careers and in your academic lives, the very purpose of being in a graduate program is to have opportunities to learn new things (or old things in new ways) and using an LLM to do the work involved in learning will only cheat you of opportunities to learn, grow, and develop deeper and more lasting skills. Finally, and more practically, if you are caught using LLMs to produce the work assigned in this class, the work will be given a 0 and you will be cited for plagiarism.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are committed to providing an accessible learning environment for all students. This includes students with physical, sensory, medical, cognitive, learning, mental health, and other disabilities. If you have, or think you may have a disability, please contact Disability Access and Inclusion Student Services (DAISS) by emailing daiss@albany.edu or calling 518 -442-5501. DAISS staff will explain the documentation and registration process, and set you up with an appointment. Once you have completed registration, you will be provided with a letter to inform your instructors that you are a student with a disability registered with DAISS, and which lists the recommended reasonable accommodations for your courses.\n\n\n\nThe Counseling Center (518-442-5800; 400 Patroon Creek Blvd, Suite 104) offers counseling and consultations regarding personal concerns, self-help information, and connections to off-campus resources. More information can be found at their site.\n\n\n\nSUNY-Albany offers a great collection available in several different media. Access to research help and library tutorials can be found online at the library‚Äôs site.\nFor information about SUNY-Albany‚Äôs Dewey Graduate Library, which is located on the Downtown Campus, visit their site.\n\n\n\nThe university offers a number of services for students who need assistance with writing and research projects. Support is available in the Writing Center (518-442-4061; 140 HU) and at the University Library. Information about the Writing Center can be found at their site.\n\n\n\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs and activities. The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies prohibit offenses defined as sexual harassment, sexual assault, intimate partner violence (dating or domestic violence), sexual exploitation, and stalking. The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies apply to the entire University at Albany community, including students, faculty, and staff of all gender identities. The University at Albany provides a variety of resources for support and advocacy to assist individuals who have experienced sexual offenses.\nConfidential support and guidance can be found through the Counseling Center (518-442-5800, or online), the University Health Center (518-442-5454, or online), and the Interfaith Center (518-489-8573, or online). Individuals at these locations will not report crimes to law enforcement or university officials without permission, except for in extreme circumstances, such as a health and/or safety emergency. Additionally, the Advocates at the University at Albany‚Äôs Advocacy Center for Sexual Violence are available to assist students without sharing information that could identify them (518-442-CARE, or online).\nSexual offenses can be reported non-confidentially to the Title IX Coordinator within The Office for Equity and Compliance (518-442-3800, or online, Building 25, Room 117) and/or the University Police Department (518-442-3131, or online).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Faculty members are considered ‚Äúresponsible employees‚Äù at the University at Albany, meaning that they are required to report all known relevant details about a complaint of sexual violence to the University‚Äôs Title IX Coordinator, including names of anyone involved or present, date, time, and location.\n\n\nIn case of an emergency, please call 911.\n\n\n\nA tentative grade given only when the student has nearly completed the course but due to circumstances beyond the student‚Äôs control the work is not completed on schedule. The date for the completion of the work is specified by the instructor. The date stipulated will not be later than one month before the end of the session following that in which the Incomplete is received. The grade I is automatically changed to E or U unless work is completed as agreed between the student and the instructor.\n\n\n\nStudents are excused, without penalty, to be absent because of religious beliefs, and will be provided equivalent opportunities for make-up examinations, study, or work requirements missed because of such absences. Students should notify the instructor of record in a timely manner, and the instructor will work directly with students to accommodate religious observances. Online courses will not schedule any assignment deadlines on religious holidays.",

Once groups are assigned, I strongly encourage you to meet with your groups with an early video call and get to know each other, your schedules, and so on. Communication helps dramatically in successful groups. That said, some group dynamics can - in very rare circumstances - become bad for all involved. I provide two means for coping: first, students can use peer evaluations to ensure accountability in group work. And second, if that is insufficient, the group can vote to remove a member and inform me of the decision. No harm, no foul. This should be considered a measure of last resort and only pursued if a group member has made no contributions to the group.",

    "text": "The following assignments will form the basis of your grade in this course:\n\nFinal Report (35 points)\nWeekly Problem Sets (30 points)\nMid-term Exam (15 points)\nFinal Exam (15 points)\nParticipation (5 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll assignments will be turned in via Brightspace.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo assess your understanding of the course material and your ability to apply concepts to real policy issues, you will be working in groups to prepare a 20 page report that i) describes a social problem with policy implications or an emerging policy issue, ii) uses data to describe the problem statistically, and iii) makes an informed recommendation on a policy change to improve the conditions that define the problem. The primary datasets used in the examples and problem sets throughout the course will be the datasets you will draw upon to construct your report. We will go over an example the second week of class to introduce you to the mix of art and science that goes into crafting good policy reports using data. You will also prepare a presentation for these results to deliver at the end of the semester (see Section¬†1.7.1).\nAcceptable sources. Generally, your research should use primary sources more than secondary sources. Primary sources include, but are not limited to: government reports, legislative hearings and testimonies, court decisions, government auditor reports, and rigorous academic research. Secondary sources are summaries and interpretations of primary sources. Secondary sources include, but are not limited to, articles from major newspapers and news magazines and more conceptual or theoretical academic research. Blogs and Wikipedia are not acceptable sources (though both can be good ways to get a broad sense of a topic before digging deeper). Be an intelligent consumer of information by evaluating secondary sources for potential political bias. If it is well known that a particular source is liberal or conservative, you must compensate for this in the paper. Acknowledge its bias and balance the information with something from a source on the other side of the political spectrum. Here are some places to start with your research, but feel free to consult other sources:\n\nAcademic research published in public administration, political science, economics, or policy journals such as: Nature Human Behaviour, Public Administration Review, Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, Journal of Public Policy Analysis and Management, American Political Science Review, American Journal of Political Science, Journal of Politics, American Economic Review, Journal of Labor Economics, Journal of Human Resources, Quarterly Journal of Economics, Policy Studies Journal.\nCongressional testimony (available through Lexis/Nexis via the library) and reports completed by Congressional committee staff\nAgency Inspector General reports\nCongressional Research Service reports\nU.S. Government Accountability Office reports\nThe library also has research support services for this class, which can be found here\n\nSubmission of papers. The final report will be due by midnight on the designated due date (details to be distributed early in the semester). Electronic versions of the paper are to be submitted via the SafeAssign link in Brightspace. It is the student‚Äôs responsibility to ensure the electronic file is readable and not corrupted. Please note: once you hit the submit button in SafeAssign, you cannot go back and submit a different version.\nLate assignments. An assignment is considered late if the paper copy is not submitted at the beginning of class, if the electronic file is not submitted before class, and/or if the electronic file is not readable. Assignments (electronic or hard copy) submitted 10 minutes after the beginning of class or the launch of the following module will be considered late and will be automatically reduced by 10%. Papers submitted one day after the due date will be automatically reduced by 20%; essays submitted two days after the assigned date will be reduced by 30%, etc. Exceptions will be made for documented extreme health and family emergencies.\n\n\n\nFor 10 weeks throughout the semester (see Section¬†1.7.1 for the specific weeks), problem sets will be posted to Brightspace and the course site by the end of the day Thursday. They will be due before the start of class the following week, leaving both weekend and weekday stretches available for you to complete the problem sets. Problem sets will involve applying concepts and activities we complete in class together to new but similar datasets and problems on your own. You will be expected to turn in 1) a clean answer sheet that provides the final solution to any problem; and 2) a .log file that shows the code used to derive the solutions to the problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe problem set will be cumulative in the sense that each week will add new concepts and issues for you to tackle that will often build on skills used the previous week. This carries two important implications. First, you will want to be careful not to miss any problem sets, as they provide important opportunities to confirm your progress in the class and understanding of the skills we are learning and missing problem sets might compound any struggles you are having. Second, each week will likely have opportunities to practice skills learned in prior weeks en route to practicing new material.\n\n\nEach problem set is worth 3 points.\n\n\n\nThere will be two in-class exams over the course of the semester. The week before the exam, study aids will be distributed and the exams will be taken in-class. Details about the exams will be provided ahead of the scheduled exams.\n\n\n\nAttendance and participation in class discussion and activities will determine the participation points you earn at the end of the semester.",

    "text": "Public policy is a professional field; therefore, I emphasize professional skills in the classroom and assignments. Professional skills are punctuality, adhering to deadlines, and preparedness.\nAfter the first week, readings for each week should be completed by the Tuesday of that week (that is, BEFORE CLASS!). While much of the class reading comes from assigned readings, I will cover other material in my lectures. You will be responsible for knowing this material too!\nA large body of well-designed research has demonstrated the detrimental effects of laptops on learning in a lecture/discussion based environment. Please be courteous and do not use your computers for anything other than class related work (taking notes and so on). Cellular phones are not to be used during class time!\nLetters of recommendation. If you are a hard working student and serious about a career in public service, I will be a dedicated advocate for you on the job market and will happily write letters of recommendation on your behalf. There is, however, one condition and one recommendation. The condition: I will not write a letter of recommendation for your while you are in my class. This is because to write a good faith, sincere, and thoughtful recommendation, I will need to be able to consider your work as a whole, and while the class is on-going, my assessment of you will be incomplete. After the semester is over, I am happy to help in any way I can, including writing letters. The recommendation: Make an appointment to visit my office hours at least once over the course of the semester to talk informally about your goals, career interests, and other professional ambitions so I can get a better sense of who you are as individuals. The better I know you, the more effective I can be at writing letters on your behalf and thinking of you when opportunities arise.\nAttend/participate in class! Again, class participation is 5% of your grade, and you can‚Äôt participate if you‚Äôre not in class or watching the class videos. If you DO need to miss class (emergencies, sickness, etc.), please contact me as soon as possible and let me know. It will be your responsibility to notify me and to get any notes/materials from other students.\nCell phones: we all have them, and they can be quite distracting. I ask that you please be courteous and silence your cell phone and leave it out of sight (in a pocket/purse/bag) during class.\nFeel free to eat and drink in class. I only ask that you do so quietly and in a manner that does not disrupt class.\nAll assignments and non-textbook readings will be posted to the class Zotero Library. I will email any announcements or updates to the class and also post them in the Blackboard. Report any trouble accessing anything on the Blackboard as soon as you encounter the problem.\nI have a strict open door policy. If there is anything about the course, the assignments, the grading, the material, class, or anything related to public administration/policy or statistics broadly that you would like to discuss, do not hesitate to visit me during office hours or email me. I can respond via email, schedule a phone call, or schedule a separate meeting. I am here to help, so please do not hesitate to reach out to me. (But please be respectful of my time!)\nHAVE FUN! Public administration/policy is a broad topic that explores big, important questions that affect everyone. Discussing these topics should be as fun and interesting as it is challenging.\nThe table below lays out the grading scale that will be used in assigning final course grades.\nStudents with special physical and/or learning needs will be accommodated. Please notify the Disabilities Office and me as soon as possible so that reasonable accommodations can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThroughout the semester, I may add or subtract readings as needed to adjust the course according to your progress, engagement, and interests.\n\n\nTable.

Each assignment is weighted by the proportion of the final grade made up by the assignment itself, as described above.\n\n\n\n\nAcademic honesty is something your professor takes very seriously. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated. Students are required to be familiar with the university‚Äôs academic honesty policies; ignorance is not an excuse for dishonest behavior. In all cases of cheating, a Violation of Academic Integrity Report will be submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies to be placed in your university file, with copies provided to you, the department head, and the Dean of Rockefeller College. Additional penalties may include some combination of the following: revision and re-submission of the assignment, reduction of the grade or failure of the assignment, reduction of the course grade or failure of the course, filing of a case with the Office of Conflict Resolution and Civic Responsibility, suspension, or expulsion. For a more detailed description of the university‚Äôs academic honesty policies, visit the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT and Other LLMs\n\n\n\nBy now, we are all aware of the technological advances in generative large language models (LLMs) trained on large quantities of written language scraped from around the internet. The University policy considers the use of ChatGPT and other generative LLMs to produce classwork without explicit permission from the instructor an act of plagiarism. I do not permit the use of ChatGPT or other generative LLMs in this course. First, generative LLMs can at times invent fictional sources, recombine information that is confidently stated but ultimately incorrect, and can produce generally mediocre and formulaic writing. Such events make the output unreliable - particularly for people aiming to be professionals working in the institutions that govern our society. Second, and more importantly, grappling with complicated trade-offs, collecting and synthesizing complex information thoughtfully, and going through the process of articulating your decisions and the knowledge base that inform them is a large part of an effective professional career. Learning in general is an arduous process that involves practice, trial and error, and confronting your current limits before finding ways to overcome them. In short, learning is work and the process by which that work occurs is often reading and writing, poorly at first and much better over time. I do think that, properly understood, LLMs can be a useful tool in managing routine tasks in which you have mastered the background, can detect and correct errors, and can use such tools effectively. However, early in your careers and in your academic lives, the very purpose of being in a graduate program is to have opportunities to learn new things (or old things in new ways) and using an LLM to do the work involved in learning will only cheat you of opportunities to learn, grow, and develop deeper and more lasting skills. Finally, and more practically, if you are caught using LLMs to produce the work assigned in this class, the work will be given a 0 and you will be cited for plagiarism.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are committed to providing an accessible learning environment for all students. This includes students with physical, sensory, medical, cognitive, learning, mental health, and other disabilities. If you have, or think you may have a disability, please contact Disability Access and Inclusion Student Services (DAISS) by emailing daiss@albany.edu or calling 518 -442-5501. DAISS staff will explain the documentation and registration process, and set you up with an appointment. Once you have completed registration, you will be provided with a letter to inform your instructors that you are a student with a disability registered with DAISS, and which lists the recommended reasonable accommodations for your courses.\n\n\n\nThe Counseling Center (518-442-5800; 400 Patroon Creek Blvd, Suite 104) offers counseling and consultations regarding personal concerns, self-help information, and connections to off-campus resources. More information can be found at their site.\n\n\n\nSUNY-Albany offers a great collection available in several different media. Access to research help and library tutorials can be found online at the library‚Äôs site.\nFor information about SUNY-Albany‚Äôs Dewey Graduate Library, which is located on the Downtown Campus, visit their site.\n\n\n\nThe university offers a number of services for students who need assistance with writing and research projects. Support is available in the Writing Center (518-442-4061; 140 HU) and at the University Library. Information about the Writing Center can be found at their site.\n\n\n\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs and activities. The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies prohibit offenses defined as sexual harassment, sexual assault, intimate partner violence (dating or domestic violence), sexual exploitation, and stalking. The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies apply to the entire University at Albany community, including students, faculty, and staff of all gender identities. The University at Albany provides a variety of resources for support and advocacy to assist individuals who have experienced sexual offenses.\nConfidential support and guidance can be found through the Counseling Center (518-442-5800, or online), the University Health Center (518-442-5454, or online), and the Interfaith Center (518-489-8573, or online). Individuals at these locations will not report crimes to law enforcement or university officials without permission, except for in extreme circumstances, such as a health and/or safety emergency. Additionally, the Advocates at the University at Albany‚Äôs Advocacy Center for Sexual Violence are available to assist students without sharing information that could identify them (518-442-CARE, or online).\nSexual offenses can be reported non-confidentially to the Title IX Coordinator within The Office for Equity and Compliance (518-442-3800, or online, Building 25, Room 117) and/or the University Police Department (518-442-3131, or online).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Faculty members are considered ‚Äúresponsible employees‚Äù at the University at Albany, meaning that they are required to report all known relevant details about a complaint of sexual violence to the University‚Äôs Title IX Coordinator, including names of anyone involved or present, date, time, and location.\n\n\nIn case of an emergency, please call 911.\n\n\n\nA tentative grade given only when the student has nearly completed the course but due to circumstances beyond the student‚Äôs control the work is not completed on schedule. The date for the completion of the work is specified by the instructor. The date stipulated will not be later than one month before the end of the session following that in which the Incomplete is received. The grade I is automatically changed to E or U unless work is completed as agreed between the student and the instructor.\n\n\n\nStudents are excused, without penalty, to be absent because of religious beliefs, and will be provided equivalent opportunities for make-up examinations, study, or work requirements missed because of such absences. Students should notify the instructor of record in a timely manner, and the instructor will work directly with students to accommodate religious observances. Online courses will not schedule any assignment deadlines on religious holidays.",

Competencies are integrative. Competencies are a bundle of knowledge, skills, abilities, and behaviors that, when fully integrated, define successful performance. Competencies are broader than knowing how to use Excel or being able to define what marginal cost means. Competencies describe the characteristics of the person who does the job best. In this way, competencies describe the whole person and their total performance. Competencies are broader than job tasks. The NASPAA identified competencies are 1) The ability to lead and manage in public governance; 2) To participate in and contribute to the policy process; 3) To analyze, synthesize, think critically, solve problems and make decisions; 4) To articulate and apply a public service perspective; 5) To communicate and interact productively with a diverse and changing workforce and citizenry.‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "text": "A Look Around Stata\nNow let‚Äôs look around Stata for a moment and get a sense of the tool. To do this, open the data for Class Lab 1 that we just moved into our data folder. You should see a screen like this. You‚Äôll notice a few things. First, in the center of the screen is the output window of Stata\n\n\n\nOutput Window\n\n\nand this is where we will see the results of any and all analysis we do. It‚Äôs a lovely view and you will come to love it as much as I do! Untold truths will be found in this screen and, if you continue down this road, you might be the first to see a brand new, scientific result in this very view! Notice out in the center, there is already a use \"E:\\rpad316\\data\\class1.dta\" command that has been run. use tells Stata to open a data set and the path (in my case E:\\rpad316\\data\\) tells Stata where the data is stored and which data set (class1.dta) to open. Datasets in Stata are always .dta file types. Think of this as the same as .doc for word.\nOkay, off to the right, you can see the list of variables in this dataset.\n\n\n\nVariables\n\n\nHere, there are two columns. One lists the variable name of each variable in the dataset. This is the equivalent of a column header in a spreadsheet and is what we use to tell Stata to do things with that particular variable. The second is the Label of each variable. Labels are more detailed, plain language descriptions of the variable, often to remind us what the variable is and how it is measured. You can also see in the bottom right corner a description of the data. Note that the description tells us that there are 7,388 observations in this dataset.\nTo the left, you can see a running record of the commands that we run.\n\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nSuccessful commands will appear in black (or in my case white) text while unsuccessful commands will appear in red. ‚ÄúUnsuccessful commands‚Äù simply means Stata hit an error because of an error in your code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome notes on Stata code. First, Stata is a literalist - it will only do what you tell it to and will only do exactly what you tell Stata to do. If you enter the wrong code or spell something wrong, Stata will just stop and do nothing else because it‚Äôs confused and has a sensitive soul. Second, Stata is case sensitive. When naming variables, use all lower case because in general, all commands and code in Stata will also be all lower case. You want to make your coding life as easy as possible and one way to avoid frustration is to name variables in a way that minimizes errors.\n\n\nFinally, we have the command window at the bottom.\n\n\n\nCommand\n\n\nThe command window is one of the ways you can tell Stata to do various things. The other way is through .do files, which we will get to in just a moment. Anything you enter into the command window will generate some sort of output in the output window and be recorded in the history window. If you make a mistake and get an error, you can click on the errant command in the history window and it will automatically be filled into the command window for you and then you can correct the error.",

It is collected cross-sectionally (that is, with new respondents) every year. The ATUS collected time diary data from a person from each household that captures how respondents spent their time over the previous 24-hrs. It is tied to a subsample of the Current Population Survey (CPS), which allows researchers to examine a rich set of individual and household characteristics.‚Ü©Ô∏é\nWe will cover commenting in do files in a future class.

    "text": "Working in Stata\nIn this class, and in general, it will be good for you to get used to working with .do files. In Stata, .do files are text files that include all of the code you are using in your project. A .do file can tell Stata what to do from start to finish and Stata will run every line of code in a .do file in order.2 To start a .do file, go to the top and click the ‚ÄúNew Do-File Editor‚Äù button () and a new .do file will open. First, let‚Äôs save this by going to ‚ÄúFile‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúSave As‚Ä¶‚Äù and save it in your class folder in the ‚Äúdo‚Äù subfolder. Name it ‚Äúclasslab1‚Äù so that you know what the do file does.\nNext, we are going to use the path to our file to set our command directory in Stata. For Windows users, getting the path is simple: go to the file explorer window where your class folder is open, click on the top bar in a space where there is no text, and you will see that the path is selected for you:\n\n\n\nPath Example\n\n\nFrom there, you can use CTRL + C to copy the file path.\nNow, return to your do file. In the first line of your do file, enter the code cd and then paste the path to your class folder (CTRL + V). The full line should read:\ncd \"C:\\rpad504\\\"\nYour path may be different, but the last part should be rpad504\\. The cd command tells Stata, ‚ÄúOkay, I am going to be working with files in this folder, so anytime I tell you to save or output something, use this as the initial path.‚Äù This will make our lives easier going foward and as long as you have a good file structure (the one I walked through here), you can simply put this line of code at the beginning of every do file and be good to go. Finally, before we begin, we will also set up a .log file. A log file tracks every command we enter and all of the output those commands produce. They are very handy tools that can keep track of what you‚Äôve done and how you did it. Researchers generally use .logs for record keeping purposes so that they can be transparent about their analysis later on down the road. Setting up a log file is easy. You simply tell Stata to start a .log and tell Stata where you would like that log to be stored.\nlocal today : di %tdCY.N.D date(\"$S_DATE\",\"DMY\")\nlog using \"logs/lab1_`today'.log\", replace\nFirst, the log command opens the log and the using command tells Stata where to create a log file to use as a log for what you‚Äôre about to do. In the quotations, the ‚Äúlogs\" segment tells Stata to use the subfolder you set up in the class folder called‚Äùlogs‚Äù (since we set up the command drive in the previous step, we only need to use the folder name!) and then the ‚Äúlab1.log‚Äù tells Stata to create a file in that folder named ‚Äúlab1‚Äù and to use it to log everything we do in our session. The , replace at the end of the command is important. It means anytime you run this .do file, it will update and overwrite the previous log file. This is a handy way to keep from having too many logs and losing track of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen you are starting a new assignment or new lab, set up a new do file, save it in the .do folder, and copy and paste the cd code and the log code from your last do file. Then you just need to rename the log file in the code and you are ready to rumble.",

    "text": "Working with Variables\nLet‚Äôs get to work on some examples. Let‚Äôs drop the existing hhincome variable and recreate it from scratch. First, we can scroll down to the bottom of the variables list in the top right corner of our Stata window:\n\n\n\nVariable List Before Drop\n\n\nand see that hhincome is the last variable in the dataset. Let‚Äôs delete it using the drop command.\ndrop hhincome\nNow we can see that it is gone from our variables list: \nNow, to demonstrate how creating and coding variables works, we are going to create a categorical variable that groups all the different household income brackets we currently have as indicator variables. First, we will create a new variable and we will set it‚Äôs value as ‚Äúmissing.‚Äù In Stata, missing is signified using the . symbol.\ngen hhincome = .\nWe should see a message that 7388 missing values have been generated, and hhincome should reappear at the bottom of our variables list:\n\n\n\nVariable List After Generating A New Variable\n\n\nClicking on the browse icon () will pull up a spreadsheet-like display of our data. Scrolling all the way to the right of the spreadsheet should reveal our new variable column, full of empty space:\n\n\n\nBackend View of Dataset In Stata\n\n\nThen we are going to tell Stata to change the value of that variable to a different number for each category of household income. Note that the second part of the command has a double equal sign.\nreplace hhincome = 1 if loinc == 1\nreplace hhincome = 2 if inc2040 == 1\nreplace hhincome = 3 if inc4060 == 1\nreplace hhincome = 4 if inc6075 == 1\nreplace hhincome = 5 if inc75100 == 1\nreplace hhincome = 6 if inc100150 == 1\nreplace hhincome = 7 if inc150p == 1\nNow we have all of our categories coded into the same variable. When we return to browsing the data and scroll to the hhincome column, we should see:\n\n\n\nBackend View of Dataset In Stata\n\n\nTo keep ourselves sane, let‚Äôs go ahead and label the new variable and label the categories so we know what they mean later.\nlabel var hhincome \"Household income\"\nlabel define inccats 1 \"&lt;=20K\" 2 \"20-40K\" 3 \"40-60K\" 4 \"60-75K\" 5 \"75-100K\" 6 \"100-150K\" 7 \"&gt;=150K\"\nlabel val hhincome inccats\nFirst, after running the first line of code above, label var, the variable list should be showing hhincome now looks something like this:\n\n\n\nNew Variable Look\n\n\nSee how much clearer that label is for us? The label will also become the default in some tables and graphs, so it will ease the burden on us over time having our variables properly labeled.\nThe second two lines of code tell Stata to create a value label scheme that defines each category with a more informative label. In our case, this is telling Stata that category 1 includes people in households earning $20,000 or less and so on. The final line of code, label val, tells Stata to apply that value label scheme to our newly created variable, hhincome. The final results should look something like this:\n\n\n\nNew Variable Look in the Backend",

    "text": "Summarizing Data\nFinally, we are going to look at the summary statistics, which includes the mean and the standard deviation, of homework time in minutes per day and hours per week for the full sample, for boys, and for girls.\nThe full sample:\nsum hw_tot weekly_hw\nWith an output that looks like this:\n. sum hw_tot weekly_hw\n\n    Variable |        Obs        Mean    Std. dev.

Let‚Äôs see how boys and girls compare in their homework time.\nHere‚Äôs only boys:\nsum hw_tot weekly_hw if male == 1\n\n    Variable |        Obs        Mean    Std. dev.

Our sample shows that while boys spend about 39 minutes studying on an average day, girls spend 55 minutes studying on the average day. That‚Äôs quite a gap in study time!\nAs we have seen so far, Stata commands usually have options that can provide additional information or customization. We can use the detail option with the sum command to get the full set of statistics, including different percentiles and variance and measures of skew. The measure of skew tells us both the size of the disagreement between the mean and the median and the direction (a negative skew indicates the mean is lower than the median, while a positive skew indicates the mean is higher than the median).\nsum hw_tot weekly_hw, detail\n\n\n                           Daily T\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n      Percentiles      Smallest\n 1%            0              0\n 5%            0              0\n10%            0              0       Obs               7,388\n25%            0              0       Sum of wgt.       7,388\n\n50%            0                      Mean           46.95168\n                        Largest       Std. dev.      87.05461\n75%           60            690\n90%          150            760       Variance       7578.505\n95%          238            790       Skewness       2.775769\n99%          390            875       Kurtosis       13.31339\n\n               Weekly homework time (in hours)\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n      Percentiles      Smallest\n 1%     1.166667       .1166667\n 5%     2.333333            .35\n10%          3.5            .35       Obs               2,842\n25%            7            .35       Sum of wgt.       2,842\n\n50%         10.5                      Mean            14.2397\n                        Largest       Std. dev.      11.97486\n75%     18.08333           80.5\n90%     30.33333       88.66666       Variance       143.3973\n95%     38.26667       92.16666       Skewness       1.969594\n99%     58.91667       102.0833       Kurtosis       8.580481\nYou can also get a more targeted set of statistics using tabstat, which allows you to specify which statistics you want and which you do not. This will come in handy later when we start using Stata to create tables for us. Remember, the analyst‚Äôs goal is to find ways to focus on the analysis and not the producing of the analysis.
