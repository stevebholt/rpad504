# Overview of Lab 2

In this week's lab, we will learn the basics of pulling data from a public data source (in this case, [IPUMS](https://www.ipums.org/)), downloading the data in a format we want (in this case Stata), and using that data to create some variables and a summary table. We will be working with data from the American Community Survey and decennial census conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The data is rich and provides a great deal of information about the U.S. population in terms of income, demographics, and so on. For our lab, we will focus simply on the living conditions, demographics, family attributes, and income mix at various levels of total income. We'll start by using IPUMS to download the data, which requires an IPUMS login.

# Downloading Data

We will start our workflow with a typical routine:

1. Download the data.
2. Move the data to our data subfolder in our class folder.
3. Begin a new .do file with our opening lines.

But first, let's download the data. IPUMS provides a harmonized set of files to enable downloading data across years and standardizing the format of variables for ease of use. Part of how that's done is using queries in the backend (we'll get to that later in the semester) prompted by a fairly straightfoward user interface (UI) on the frontend. We'll be using the [IPUMS ACS data](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml).

The link to the landing page should look like this:

We want to do our own analysis using our own tools, so let's go ahead and click "Get Data." From there, we'll land at a starting menu that looks like this:

From here, we'll want to make sure we are logged in - use the login button at the top right of the screen - and then we will begin by selecting samples using the big blue "Select Samples" button on the left. Scrolling down a bit, you will see a list of potential samples with some already checked.

The ACS is collected annually and sampled households are not eligible for resample for 5 years. There are a variety of caveats, subsamples, and other considerations that warrant reading some of the codebooks when doing something more sophisticated than a class exercise, but for our purposes, we will be using fairly common variables collected in most years in a pretty standard format. The sample years selected will determine the set of variables that are available in all years and the samples to be included in our final dataset. For the purposes of this exercise, let's just select 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022 and deselect everything else in this window. We will then hit "Submit Sample Selections" at the top of the screen.

Notice that the data cart at the top now has "4 samples" in it: ![](datacart1.png)

This means that as we look at variables, we'll have indicators for the variable availability in those four samples (i.e., the four years of the ACS we chose) and we
