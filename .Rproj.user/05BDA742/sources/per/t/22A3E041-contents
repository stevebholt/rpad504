## Instructions

This problem set will require 3 file submissions: 1) a clean .do file with the commands used to answer the questions, 2) a .log file with the all the output from the commands used to answer the questions, and 3) a clean word document with the answers to the questions. You will submit all three files via Brightspace.

For this problem set, you will need to use the [Current Population Survey data from IPUMS](https://cps.ipums.org/cps/). Use the "Get Data" feature and in the ASEC tab select only the 2023 sample.

For this assignment, you will be using four variables to describe health, employment, income, health expenditures. In parentheses below are the menus paths to find the listed variables. Complete your dataset by adding: 

1. HEALTH (Person -> Annual Social and Economic Supplement -> Disability)
2. FTOTVAL (Person -> Annual Social and Economic Supplement -> Income)
3. EMPSTAT (Person -> Core -> Work)
4. MOOP (Person -> Annual Social and Economic Supplement -> Health Insurance)

This should leave you with 4 variables in 1 sample. Use the data to answer the following questions.

## Questions

1. What is the average and median family income in the sample?

4. What is the difference in average out of pocket spending on health costs between people with excellent health and people with poor health?


5. What is the difference in average out of pocket spending on health costs between people in the top decile of family income and people in the bottom decile of family income?

::: callout-tip
Your table should have 7 variable rows and 3 columns of statistics.
