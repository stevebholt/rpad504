# Overview
To assess your understanding of the course material and your ability to apply concepts to real policy issues, you will be working in groups to prepare a 10 page report that i) describes a social problem with policy implications or an emerging policy issue, ii) uses data to describe the problem statistically, and iii) makes an informed recommendation on a policy change to improve the conditions that define the problem. The primary datasets used in the examples and problem sets throughout the course will be the datasets you will draw upon to construct your report. We will go over an example the second week of class to introduce you to the mix of art and science that goes into crafting good policy reports using data. You will also prepare a presentation for these results to deliver at the end of the semester.
