# Data Basics
## Types of Data
### Broad Types of Data
:::{.incremental}
- Qualitative data
  - Texts (e.g., reports, articles, books), audio or visual media, observations, transcripts
  - Collected using: Notes from observation or attendance, focus groups, various forms of interviews
  - Often used for deeper forms of clarification, better understanding an institutional context, or developing new items for larger scale data collection
- Quantitative data
  - Cross-sectional or longitudinal
  - Collected using: Digitized administrative records or surveys
  - Often used for large scale examinations of trends, tests of formal hypotheses, or estimating program and policy impact

:::

### Sources of Data
:::{.incremental}
- Government agencies
  - Bureau of Labor Statistics, Census Bureau, National Center for Education Statistics, National Institutes of Health
  - State agencies in every state shares varying degrees of data
- Private data vendors
- Nonprofit financial disclosures
  - Guidestar data

- Often these sources will provide an Excel (or more commonly comma-separated values (CSV) format) or flat file of data, sometimes with code for other uses (Stata, R, SAS, SPSS) or with direct files in other formats

- An important resource for the purposes of our class is [IPUMS](https://www.ipums.org/)

:::

### Survey data basics
:::{.incremental}
- Typically uses a sample of the population
  - Representative samples
    - Simple Random Sample
    - Stratified Random Sample
    - Multi-stage random sample
  - Convenience sample
    - People you know, nearby, etc.
- Samples face a representativeness and efficiency trade-off
- Often surveys come with technical codebooks that report how variables are measured, response rates, weighting schemes, and many, many other important details

### Example - Why Details Matter
**Happy Ever After** by Paul Dolan makes this claim:
![Read Codebooks](readcodebooks.png)
The problem here is ATUS [does not work that way](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/4/18650969/married-women-miserable-fake-paul-dolan-happiness)...

### Administrative data
:::{.incremental}
- Many public organizations - and private entities that receive public money - are required to collect and report a wide range of data by law(s)
  - Employee information forms, complaint documentation, expenditure documentation, performance information, contacts with the public
  - Sometimes data is submitted via paper form and digitized later, sometimes the law specifies a mode of data transfer, sometimes "forms" are used that are actually user interfaces for a database
- Full universe of recipients of service and often detailed records, but...
- Messy, can be subject to biased reporting from street-level

:::

## Basic structures of Data
### Dataset ingredients
:::{.incremental}
- Rows: define individual observations at the smallest unit of analysis
- Columns: define variables in a dataset or characteristics of a unit that **varies** across units

# Exercise
## Setting Up
### Getting Started in Stata
[Lab Number 1!](https://stevebholt.github.io/rpad504/lab1.html)

# Concluding

### Wrap
:::{.incremental}
- You have the basic lay of the land of datasets
- Next week:
  - Data quality and visualization
  - Basic visualization functions in Excel
  - Download data from a source and importing into Stata
  - Finding and reading codebooks and metadata
